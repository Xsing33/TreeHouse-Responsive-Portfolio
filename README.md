Responsive Portfolio Using: Flexbox, Grid, &amp;Media Queries

My main strengths here were flexbox & grid as I used one or the other to lay this project out. 
My main weaknesses here were Media queries, Code Organization, & element naming.
The last two are very fixable, I just need to be more aware of how I am naming my sections and elements, BEM will be very helpful in this regard. For the Code Organization aspect Comments and maybe separation of concern would help. SASS would be very helpful in this regard.
